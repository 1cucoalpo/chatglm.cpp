# How to Activate X-Mirage for Windows with a Crack
 
X-Mirage is a software that allows you to mirror and record your iOS devices' screen on your Windows PC. It supports AirPlay and Google Cast compatible devices, and can also capture voiceover from your microphone. However, X-Mirage is not a free software, and you need to purchase a license key to activate it.
 
If you don't want to pay for the license key, you can try to activate X-Mirage with a crack. A crack is a program that modifies the original software to bypass the activation process. However, using a crack is illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Therefore, we do not recommend using a crack to activate X-Mirage.
